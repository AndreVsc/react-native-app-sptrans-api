# SP Transportes

## Introduction

The **SP Transportes** project is a mobile application developed with **React Native** that aims to improve the visibility and accessibility of public transport for users in downtown SÃ£o Paulo. Through the integration with **SPTrans' Olho Vivo API**, the app displays real-time bus lines, allowing users to search, view, and track the status of bus routes directly on an interactive Google Map.

Additionally, to enhance user interaction, other APIs were incorporated, such as the **Google Maps API** and geolocation features for an improved navigation experience.

## App Design

The app's design was created in Figma, following a minimalist and intuitive layout to make it easy to use, whether the user is familiar with technology or has little experience. The main screens include:

1. **Prototype**: Initial draft of the app's functionalities.
2. **Menu**: Initial screen with navigation options.
3. **Bus Line Selection**: Displays available bus line options.
4. **Selected Bus Line Display**: Shows the selected bus line on the map.
5. **Search State**: Allows users to search for a specific bus line.

All images related to the app prototype and its states are stored in the \`public\` folder, named \`image-1.jpeg\` to \`image-5.jpeg\`.
